                    <p2>After over 10 years in Business International,  I have acquired a wealth of experience in the Saas world by engaging with large organisations across industries regarding their challenges and strategic plans.
                        Having recently taken the leap into software development, I can capitalise on my experience and recent knowledge to help organisations grow and help focus on what really matters.
